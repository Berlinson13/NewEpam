I be that skinny fiend sippin' lean, caffeine with codeine
I'm smoking nicotine, PCP, pills in my cuisine
I'm fucking draped in suede, wrist dismayed, $uicide renegade
Pop a couple waves up in my grave, carvin' my skin with the blade
I-I don't fuck with squealers, known drug dealer, stealer with the sealer
$lickity always wrecked, bitch, get checked
Grey 5-9 the set, chopper make 'em wet
Watch me flex, y'all just second best
Never second guess, manifest, triple six 'til death
